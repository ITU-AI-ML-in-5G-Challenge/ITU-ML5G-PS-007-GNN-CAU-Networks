# ITU-ML5G-PS-007-GNN-CAU-Networks


1)This solution is not modified from the baseline.  
- 1. I used CBR+MB Model.
- 2. I used random fold.

2)Everything else is same from the baseline, the different thing to point out was that I trained back and forth from CBR+MB dataset and MB dataset. Make sure to use CBR model for every epoch.

3) The source code should be unnecessary since it is on [Github](https://github.com/BNN-UPC/GNNetworkingChallenge/tree/2023_RealNetworkDT). Every parameter is the same.
